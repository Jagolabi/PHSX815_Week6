# Gaussint

The programs available in this repository:

* Gaussint.py [Python]
* MonteCarloInt.py [Python]

# Utilization

The usage of two separate plotting libraries necessitates independent download, setup, and installation by users.

* Sympy (python)
* numpy (pyhon)
* scipy (pyhon)

# Example usage

The python file `Gaussint.py` can be run from the command line by typing:

`<> python Gaussint.py`

This requires a working `Python` distribution (so that the python executable exists) with the Python package `numpy` and `Matplotlib` also installed.
